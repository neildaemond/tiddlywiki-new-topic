#Tiddlywiki New Topic

This is a tuned tiddlywiki which I use to quickly start mind-mapping/documenting new ideas/tasks. This is the classic tiddlywiki 4, found at http://classic.tiddlywiki.com/


The wiki is one file, template_empty.html and uses TiddlySaver.jar to save cahnges on your local machine. You can also use the tiddlywiki plugin on firefox to save changes.

tiddlertoddly.html is not written by me, but it is a good reference wiki to learn in the in and outs of tiddlywiki.
